# Preface
After fourteen years of teaching, I decided to compile the best in-class examples that I have shared with my students into one compendium that all learners of web development/design can use in their course of study. Of the myriad examples I have created over the years, I chose those examples that generated the most positive reaction from my students. “Aha” moments, if you will.

Many, but not all, of the tags in the HTML language are explained in this book; only those used most often in web sites. With an understanding of the essential HTML tags, learning any other tags will be simple.

This book is about learning HTML correctly, which will help in search results, readability for you and others maintaining your HTML, and for accessibility on the web.
